Note:
There is some small frame loss in the big-list fetched from the API that can be solved in a relative easy manner using Isolates, though the time had just caught up;
Also, the challenge was pretty fun to make, if i had more time i would definetly make some aspects of it more reliable and the code more Robust, though i did not proper documented it
I would have started doing that by now mainly because it just started to gain some size (lines of code);
There is a important detail on the data structures that, due to the short time, I did not spend as much time as it was worth spending;
Thaks for the Tractian Team for the opportunitty;
