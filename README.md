Ensure proper versioning:
```Flutter 3.13.8 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework • revision nixpkgs000 () • 1970-01-01 00:00:00
Engine • revision 767d8c75e8
Tools • Dart 3.1.4 • DevTools 2.25.0
```

Then it is just In the root directory run 

```
flutter run --release
```

Note:
There is some small frame loss in the big-list fetched from the API that can be solved in a relative easy manner using Isolates, though the time had just caught up;
